## Overview
This file provides a [sample of the code](code/model.R) used in Zhang et al.  [Manuscript in review at Nature Communications]. This code is intended for transparency and reproducibility and is not able to run.

This project uses dataset that involves daily and county-level information on stroke mortality, air pollution and meteorological exposure during 2013 and 2022 in 304 Chinese counties.

This project also include [data1](data/data1.xlsx) and [data2](data/data2.xlsx). [Data1](data/data1.xlsx) was selected from a sub-dataset spanning the period from 2013 to 2018.  A two-stage time series analytical approach was utilized to examine the association between daily relative temperature and mortality risk. For validation, [data2](data/data2.xlsx) from 2019 to 2022 were selected as the evaluation set. Both [data1](data/data1.xlsx) and [data2](data/data2.xlsx) are sample data, rather than original datasets.
