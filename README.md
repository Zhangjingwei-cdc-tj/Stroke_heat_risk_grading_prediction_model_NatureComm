## Overview
This file provides a [sample of the code](code/model.R) used in Zhang et al.  [Manuscript Title: Benefits of Interventional Applications of the Stroke Heat Risk Grading Prediction Model: An Integrated Modeling Study]. This code is intended for transparency and reproducibility and is not able to run.

This project utilized daily, county-level data on stroke mortality, air pollution, and meteorological exposures from 2013 to 2022 across 304 counties in China.

This project also included processed [data1](data/data1.xlsx) and [data2](data/data2.xlsx). [Data1](data/data1.xlsx) was selected from a sub-dataset spanning the period from 2013 to 2018.  A two-stage time series analytical approach was utilized to examine the association between daily relative temperature and mortality risk. For validation, [data2](data/data2.xlsx) from 2019 to 2022 were selected as the evaluation dataset. Both [data1](data/data1.xlsx) and [data2](data/data2.xlsx) represent processed sample data rather than original datasets.
